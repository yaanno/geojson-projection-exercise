## Key Observations

1. **Performance Scaling**

   - Linear scaling for most operations
   - Sub-linear scaling observed for very large LineStrings (50,000 points)
   - Consistent performance across different geometry types

2. **Stability**

   - Low outlier rate (2-7% of measurements)
   - Most outliers are high-severity
   - Performance is predictable and consistent

3. **Memory Usage**

   - Stable memory patterns
   - Few severe outliers indicating good memory management
   - Buffer pool effectively manages memory allocation

4. **Optimization History**
   - Attempted batch processing showed performance regression
   - Original implementation provides better performance
   - Current implementation balances memory usage and processing speed

## Recommendations

1. **Current Implementation**

   - Maintain current approach for optimal performance
   - Continue using buffer pool for memory management
   - Monitor outlier rates for potential issues

2. **Future Considerations**
   - Consider parallel processing for very large geometries
   - Monitor performance with different coordinate systems
   - Evaluate memory usage patterns with larger datasets

## Benchmark Methodology

- 100 samples per benchmark
- Release mode optimization
- Standard deviation within acceptable ranges
- Outliers defined as measurements outside 1.5 \* IQR

## Notes

- Performance characteristics may vary based on:
  - System resources
  - Coordinate system complexity
  - Geometry complexity
  - Memory pressure
- Regular benchmarking recommended to track performance changes
